# **System Logs**  

## **1. Module Overview**

The **System Logs** module acts as the **operational audit center** of MIM CRM, centrally storing and displaying all high-privilege user actions within the system. It supports real-time monitoring and offers powerful search and filtering capabilities to help teams quickly identify anomalies, troubleshoot issues, or fulfill regulatory requirements. Key features include:

- ✅ Logging critical operations (logins, account creation/deletion, fund adjustments)  
- ✅ Capturing operator identity, IP address, timestamp, and detailed descriptions  
- ✅ Multi-dimensional querying by time, name, phone number, or IP address  
- ✅ Raw data export capability for advanced analysis  

> 🔐 Logs are accessible only to **Super Administrators** or **Compliance Auditors**. All entries are immutable and non-deletable to ensure integrity and legal admissibility.

## **3. Core Feature Details**

### **1. Log Collection Mechanism**

#### **Data Sources**
Logs are automatically generated by backend services and cover the following critical events:
- User login/logout  
- Administrator/user creation, editing, or deletion  
- Permission changes (role assignments)  
- Fund operations (deposits, withdrawals, transfers)  
- Configuration updates (currency, payment channels, system parameters)

> ⚠️ Note: Actions by regular end-users are **not** recorded; only high-privilege operations are logged.

#### **Retention Policy**
- Logs are stored permanently and cannot be deleted  
- Data is encrypted at rest to prevent tampering  
- Each entry includes a unique ID, timestamp, contextual metadata, and full audit trail

### **2. Search & Filtering Capabilities**

#### **Advanced Filter Options**
| Control | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Start Date ~ End Date** | Time range selection (supports days, weeks, months) |
| **Name / Phone Search** | Fuzzy match by admin name or phone number |
| **IP Address Search** | Exact-match lookup by client IP |

> 💡 Pro Tip: Combine “IP Address” with “Time Range” to rapidly isolate suspicious login sources.

---

### **3. Log Analysis Techniques**

#### **A. Anomalous Login Detection**
- **Scenario**: An admin frequently logs in from different countries  
- **Steps**:
  1. Go to **System Logs** → Set time range (e.g., last 7 days)  
  2. Search by admin name  
  3. Review IP address history for geographic inconsistency  
  4. Flag logins from unexpected regions (e.g., switching from China to the U.S.)

> 📊 Output: Generate an **Anomalous Login Report** for security team follow-up.

---

#### **B. Privilege Abuse Review**
- **Scenario**: Suspected unauthorized account creation  
- **Steps**:
  1. Filter logs by action name: `CREATE_ADMIN` or `CREATE_USER`  
  2. Verify if the executor is authorized  
  3. Assess business justification for the new account  
  4. Treat unapproved creations as policy violations

> 📊 Output: Tag suspicious entries and escalate to compliance.

---

#### **C. Incident Troubleshooting**
- **Scenario**: Payment channels suddenly become unavailable  
- **Steps**:
  1. Check for recent `UPDATE_PAYMENT_CHANNEL` operations  
  2. Identify the modifier and exact timestamp  
  3. Reconstruct the change context using historical parameters  
  4. Determine if misconfiguration caused the outage

> 📊 Output: Produce a **Root Cause Analysis Report** to improve processes.

## **4. Typical Use Cases**

### **Use Case 1: Regulatory Audit Preparation**  
> 🎯 Goal: Submit system activity records for the past 30 days to regulators

- ✅ Procedure:
  1. Go to **System Logs** → Set date range: `26/01/2026 to 26/02/2026`  
  2. Export all logs (CSV or Excel format)  
  3. Append a summary: total operations, anomaly count, IP distribution map  
  4. Deliver to audit department

> ✅ Outcome: Meets KYC/AML reporting standards and enhances compliance rating.

---

### **Use Case 2: Internal Security Audit**  
> 🎯 Goal: Periodically verify absence of privilege misuse

- ✅ Procedure:
  1. Monthly, filter for `CREATE_ADMIN` and `DELETE_USER` actions  
  2. Cross-check executors against approved roles  
  3. Flag any changes made without dual approval  
  4. Issue a **Privilege Change Audit Report** to management

> ✅ Outcome: Strengthens internal controls and reduces human error risk.

---

### **Use Case 3: Responding to Account Compromise**  
> 🎯 Goal: Confirm if an admin account was hijacked

- ✅ Procedure:
  1. Immediately lock the suspected account  
  2. Search **System Logs** by admin name  
  3. Identify post-last-normal-login anomalies (e.g., mass account creation, password resets)  
  4. Extract IP addresses and perform geolocation  
  5. Coordinate with network security to block malicious IPs

> ✅ Outcome: Rapid containment and system recovery.

---

## **5. Best Practices**

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Daily Monitoring** | Set up automated daily email digests summarizing key actions (logins, permission changes) |
| **Retention Policy** | Retain logs for at least 5 years to comply with global financial regulations |
| **Access Control** | Restrict log access to Compliance, IT, and Security teams only |
| **Automated Analytics** | Integrate with SIEM tools (e.g., Splunk) for real-time anomaly alerts |
| **Incident Response** | Maintain a **System Logs Incident Response Playbook** with clear roles and escalation paths |

## **6. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

### **Q1: Why are some actions missing from the logs?**  
- ❌ Possible reasons:  
  - The action is low-risk (e.g., user browsing pages)  
  - Logging is disabled in system configuration  

> ✅ Solution: Confirm if the action qualifies as sensitive; contact support to verify logging status.

---

### **Q2: Can logs be deleted or hidden?**  
- ❌ No. All logs are read-only, immutable, and non-deletable to preserve audit integrity.

---

### **Q3: How can I export logs for external analysis?**  
- ✅ Methods:  
  1. Manually copy table content → paste into Excel  
  2. Use the CRM API for bulk extraction (requires developer support)  
  3. Submit a feature request for native CSV export (not yet available in current version)

---

### **Q4: Can IP addresses be geolocated?**  
- ✅ Yes. Third-party services (e.g., MaxMind, IPinfo) can map IPs to country/city level, aiding legitimacy assessment.
