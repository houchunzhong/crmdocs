## **4. Best Practices**

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| **New Campaign Launch** | Monitor “Daily Visits” and “Daily Conversion Rate” for the first 3 days to assess initial performance |

| **Conversion Bottleneck** | If “Registration Completion Rate” is consistently low, audit the registration form for UX or technical issues |
| **Campaign Evaluation** | Compare pre- and post-campaign “Overall Conversion Rate” to quantify ROI |
| **Channel Optimization** | Prioritize budget allocation to channels with high “Deposit Conversion Rate”; reduce spend on low-performing ones |

## **5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

### **Q1: Why is “Registration Rate” different from “Registration Completion Rate”?**  
✅ Because they use different denominators:  
- **Registration Rate** = `Registrations / Unique Visitors` → measures attraction  
- **Registration Completion Rate** = `Completed Registrations / Registrations` → measures process efficiency  

### **Q2: Can I export this data?**  
✅ Yes. Click the **“Export CSV”** button in the bottom-right corner to download all current report data.

### **Q3: Is a higher “Visit-to-Registration Page Rate” always better?**  
⚠️ Not necessarily. High interest must be validated by downstream metrics like **Registration Rate** and **Deposit Conversion Rate**. Focusing only on this metric may mislead optimization efforts.

### **Q4: How can I view data beyond the default period?**  
⚠️ The current version supports the last **30 days** of data. Custom date-range filtering will be available in a future release.
