# **Agent Applications Module: User Guide**  

## **1. Module Overview**

The **Agent Applications** module functions as the **agent onboarding control center** of MIM CRM. It captures and manages all “Become an Agent” requests submitted by users. The system automatically populates a pending-review list with complete profile and KYC data, enabling administrators to assess eligibility before granting IB status. This ensures only qualified, trustworthy users are authorized as agents—mitigating fraud risks and regulatory exposure.
