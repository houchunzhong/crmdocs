### **2. Order Commissions Main View**

| **Instrument** | Traded symbol (e.g., `EURUSD`, `GBPUSD`, `USD/JPY`) |
| **Volume** | Opening lot size (e.g., `0.20`) |
| **Closed Volume** | Closed portion of the position (e.g., `0.00` = still open) |
| **Total Order Commission** | Commission amount generated by this order (`--` indicates not yet calculated) |
| **Trade Time** | Timestamp of execution (to the second) |

#### **Status Indicators**
- ✅ **Green circle ✓**: Calculation successful; commission generated

- 🟡 **Yellow square □**: Pending or warning status  

> ⚠️ Example: Order `10702` shows “Calculation Failed” with error: *“order ticket id: 184 symbol: EURUSD not in rebate type”* — indicating the instrument isn’t covered by any active commission plan.

### **3. Filtering & Search**

## **4. Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Q1: Why does “Total Order Commission” show `--` for some orders?**  
- ❌ Possible causes:  
  - Order is still being processed (not settled)  
  - Trading system hasn’t fully synced data  
  - The instrument lacks a configured commission rule  

> ✅ Solution: Wait for system sync; or verify commission plan settings in **Tiers & Commissions → Commission Plans**.

---

### **Q2: How to fix “Calculation Failed” orders?**  
- ✅ Steps:  
  1. Locate the failed order (e.g., `10702`) in **Order Commissions**  
  2. Review the error message (e.g., “not in rebate type”)  
  3. Go to **Tiers & Commissions → Commission Plans**  
  4. Add the missing instrument (e.g., `EURUSD`) to the relevant plan  
  5. Trigger recalculation (system auto-retries or manual refresh)

---

### **Q3: Why is “User Commission” always 0?**  
- ✅ By design: Commissions default to agents only. End users receive no share unless explicitly configured.  
- To enable user rebates, activate “User Rebate Rate” in the **Tiers & Commissions** module.

---

### **Q4: Can I export order commission data?**  
- ❌ Not directly in the current version.  
- ✅ Workaround: Copy table content manually or use the CRM API for bulk data extraction (requires technical support).

## **5. Best Practices**

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Daily Monitoring** | Check “Failed” orders daily to maintain system health |
| **Anomaly Investigation** | Regularly analyze failure patterns (e.g., specific instruments or platforms) |
| **Rule Validation** | After updating commission plans, immediately verify results in this module |
| **Cross-Platform Analysis** | Compare commission distribution across MT5, AQX, and BO to evaluate strategy effectiveness |
| **Compliance Auditing** | Use this module as the source of truth for financial reconciliation and regulatory reporting |
